- What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden directory with metadata.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory refers to the whole directory while staging area
refers to specific files we are tracking. We can chose wether or not 
a file should be part of the next commit.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?

By staging only those files which contributes to the logical change.

- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

the working version.
