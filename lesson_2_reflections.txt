- What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden directory with metadata.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory refers to the whole directory while staging area
refers to specific files we are tracking. We can chose wether or not 
a file should be part of the next commit.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?

By staging only those files which contributes to the logical change.

- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

When I want to experiment new features or refactor my code without losing
the working version.

- How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps me visualize how a branch work and why i could not be able to
reach certain commit given the nature of git structure.

- What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it 
in the diagram the way we do?

The result is the sum of all the commits of two to branches. Because we have 
nothing better to do.
