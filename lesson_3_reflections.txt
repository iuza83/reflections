- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with other people or letting them contribute to my project.
Or to have my code in sync among several different machines.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it can takes different commits to have a certain change be effective and I don't want
to push intermediate incomplete versions of a branch.  

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks means making a copy of a repository in order to being able to make changes without affecting the original repository. Clone is used to copy a repository on your local machine. Branch is used when you would like to explore different paths in your project without affecting the main working branch.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is to have the latest changes made to the remote should you be unable to pull the remote in the immediate future.

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would use one of the avaible cloud storage services. It would be easier to set a project but it would be harder to track all changes.

- When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I will make changes in a separate branch when I know it will take times to complete my changes and I don't want to break the master branch. I will use it either to collaborate with other people and make it sure that my changes are reviewed by my collaborator before being merged to the master branch.
