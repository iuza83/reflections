- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with other people or letting them contribute to my project.
Or to have my code in sync among several different machines.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it can takes different commits to have a certain change be effective and I don't want
to push intermediate incomplete versions of a branch.
