-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helps me to see the bugs introduced because it points out 
all the changes made from one version to another.

- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because i can reverse changes made to a file if such changes 
broke my program or doesn't accomplish what it was supposed to.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The pros are that you can choose a meaningful time to commit a
specific logical change. The cons are that you can forget to commit 
your changes and going too far in changes without having a clear
vision of your project's history.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?

I can use git log to see all the commits of a projects and i can use 
the git diff <id1> <id2> to see the differences between the state of
the project from one commit to another.

- How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?

Because I can always revert all changes I've made.

- Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it for some of my projects.
